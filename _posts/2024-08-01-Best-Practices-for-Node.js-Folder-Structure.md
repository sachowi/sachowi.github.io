title: Best Practices for Node.js Folder Structure
---

When developing applications with Node.js, organizing your project's folder structure is crucial for maintainability, scalability, and collaboration. A well-structured folder hierarchy not only makes it easier to manage your codebase but also helps other developers understand and contribute to your project effectively. In this article, we'll explore best practices for organizing a Node.js project folder structure.

#### 1. **Root-Level Directories and Files**

At the root level of your Node.js project, you should have several key directories and files:

- **`package.json`**: Contains metadata about your project, including dependencies, scripts, and project information. This is the cornerstone of Node.js projects.

- **`README.md`**: Provides documentation and information about your project, such as setup instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution details.

- **`node_modules/`**: Automatically created by npm (or yarn), this directory holds all your project's dependencies. It's not usually included in version control (e.g., Git).

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git. Typically, `node_modules/` and other build artifacts are listed here.

- **`.env`**: (Optional) Stores environment variables used by your application. It’s important to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to keep sensitive information secure.

#### 2. **Core Directories**

Organizing your project into core directories helps in managing different aspects of your application. Here’s a common structure:

- **`src/`**: This is where the main application code resides. It’s a good practice to keep all source files here to distinguish them from configuration files and build artifacts.

  - **`controllers/`**: Contains files that handle the logic for processing incoming requests and returning responses. Controllers interact with models and handle application-specific logic.

  - **`models/`**: Defines the data structure and interacts with the database. Models represent the data and business logic of your application.

  - **`routes/`**: Contains route definitions that map HTTP requests to controller actions. Organizing routes separately helps manage different endpoints more effectively.

  - **`middlewares/`**: Includes custom middleware functions used in your application, such as authentication and error handling.

  - **`services/`**: (Optional) Contains business logic and services that interact with external APIs or perform complex operations.

  - **`utils/`**: Holds utility functions and helpers used across the application.

  - **`config/`**: Stores configuration files and settings for different environments (development, testing, production).

- **`tests/`**: Contains test files and test-related configurations. Keeping tests separate from source code makes it easier to manage and run them independently.

- **`public/`**: (For web applications) Contains static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images that are served to the client.

- **`views/`**: (For web applications using templating engines) Holds view templates that are rendered to generate HTML responses.

- **`scripts/`**: (Optional) Contains various scripts used for development tasks, such as database seeding or build scripts.

#### 3. **Sample Folder Structure**

Here’s an example of how these directories might be organized:

```
my-nodejs-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── images/
├── src/
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── config.js
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   └── userController.js
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── userModel.js
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── userRoutes.js
│   ├── middlewares/
│   │   └── authMiddleware.js
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── userService.js
│   ├── utils/
│   │   └── helperFunctions.js
│   └── index.js
├── tests/
│   ├── user.test.js
│   └── setupTests.js
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── .env
```

#### 4. **Additional Considerations**

- **Modularity**: Keep related files together, but avoid making directories too granular. Striking a balance between modularity and simplicity is key.

- **Consistency**: Use consistent naming conventions and structure throughout your project. Consistent organization helps team members navigate and understand the codebase more easily.

- **Scalability**: As your application grows, be prepared to refactor and reorganize directories to accommodate new features and complexities.

- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation within your code and project files to ensure that new developers can quickly understand the purpose and structure of your project.

By following these best practices for folder structure, you can build a well-organized and maintainable Node.js application that is easier to develop, test, and scale.
